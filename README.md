# Subgraph Isomorphism Benchmarks
Testing the state of the art for subgraph isomorphism.

## Repository
The repository is structured as follows:
- `repo` this folder contains all the other repository of the algorithms to test;
- `scripts` contains all the script to parse data in the several formats required by all the algorithms;
- `data` contains all the graph tested and a script called `init.sh` that must be run to initialize data to the algorithms format;
