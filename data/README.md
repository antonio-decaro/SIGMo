# Dataset
The `data.smarts` and the `query.smarts` have been taken from the following work:
- Ehrlich, HC., Rarey, M. Systematic benchmark of substructure search in molecular graphs - From Ullmann to VF2. J Cheminform 4, 13 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-4-13

The ZINC_URLS file contains the URL to download the molecules of the [ZINC](https://zinc.docking.org/tranches/home/) dataset tested for the multi-node experiments.

The nodes graph with only one node have been removed.
